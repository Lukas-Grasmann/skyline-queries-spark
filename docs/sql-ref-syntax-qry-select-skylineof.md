### Description

The `SKYLINE OF` clause is used to compute the skyline of the results produced by
`HAVING` based on the specified dimensions. It is executed after the [HAVING](sql-ref-syntax-qry-select-having.html) Clause but before the [ORDER BY](sql-ref-syntax-qry-select-orderby.html)
clause.

### Syntax

```sql
SKYLINE OF [ DISTINCT ] [ COMPLETE | BNL ] { expression { MIN | MAX | DIFF } [ , ... ] }
```

### Parameters

* **SKYLINE OF**

  Specifies a comma-separated list of skyline dimensions and whether they are minimized (MIN), maximized (MAX) or different (DIFF).
  Optionally, it can be specified whether a skyline dimension is distinct for each dimension. Distinct selection may be completely random.
  Computation follows the definition provided in [Stephan Börzsönyi, Donald Kossmann, Konrad Stocker: The Skyline Operator. ICDE 2001: 421-430].

* **expression**

  Specifies an expression that represents a skyline dimension. Typically is a column but may also be an alias or similar.

* **DISTINCT**

  Specifies that a given skyline should be distinct i.e. data points which are the same for every dimension are eliminated.

* **COMPLETE**

  Specified that a given skyline does not contain missing values i.e. no null values.
  This forces Spark to use algorithms under the assumption that no missing values are present even if columns are nullable.
  
  ***WILL PRODUCE UNEXPECTED RESULTS IF NULL VALUES ARE ENCOUNTERED***
  
  The appropriate complete or incomplete algorithm will be chosen automatically if option is not specified based on nullability.
  Performance of incomplete algorithms may be inferior to complete algorithms on complete inputs but the output is correct regardless.

  Alternatively, a non-distributed block-nested-loop approach can also be forced by using **BNL** instead.

* **MIN**

  Specifies that a given skyline dimension should be minimized i.e. a smaller value dominates a bigger value.

* **MAX**

  Specifies that a given skyline dimension should be minimized i.e. a bigger value dominates a smaller value.

* **DIFF**

  Specifies that a given skyline dimension should be different i.e. a if the value on the dimension is different for two tuples, then both can be part of the skyline.
